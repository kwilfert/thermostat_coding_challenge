# Thermostat coding challenge

This little challenge project is based on a standard Vue3 Hello World project.
Instructions here should suffice to get this project up and running.

I am adding this little additional documentation in post after my work has been completed.
Thank you to the company, who reached out and provided me with this challenge.

While my goal was to use the commit timestamps as a means of displaying accurate development progress,
my two coffee runs and a quick restroom break have to be factored in.
The actual development time is close to 1h 10min.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
